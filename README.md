# OpenCIL: Benchmarking Out-of-Distribution Detection in Class-Incremental Learning

## Description  
OpenCIL is the first benchmark platform expressly tailored both post-hoc-based and fine-tuning-based out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods for different types of class incremental learning (CIL) models,  evaluating the capability of CIL models in rejecting diverse OOD samples.
OpenCIL offers a flexible algorithmic template that allows users to effortlessly implement their unique designs within the platform.
Moreover, it provides a new evaluation protocol to fairly and systematically compare diverse OOD detection methods among different incremental steps, and comprehensively evaluate 60 baselines that are composed by 15 OOD detectors and 4 CIL models.
We further propose a new baseline called BER that can effectively mitigate the common issues in the 60 baselines.
